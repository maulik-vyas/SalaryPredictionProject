Salary Prediction Project (Python)

The main object of this assignment is to examine a set of job postings with salaries and then predict salaries for a new set of job postings. The model will decide the remunerations for present as well as future employees of any organization.

With the help of Machine Learning, salaries will be forecasted depending upon years of experience, job type, college degree, college major, industry, and miles from a metropolis.

The raw data comprises training and test dataset in which training set has aforementioned attribues with the corresponding salaries while test dataset does not have salary information and would act as a real-world dataset.

The features of the datasets:

> - **Years Experience:** How many years of experience any person has?<br>
> - **Job Type:** The position held (CEO, CFO, CTO, Vice President, Manager, Senior, Junior, Janitor).<br>
> - **Degree:** Doctoral, Masters, Bachelors, High School, or None.<br>
> - **Major:** Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Literature, Math, Physics, or None.<br>
> - **Industry:** Auto, Education, Finance, Health, Oil, Service, or Web.<br>
> - **Miles From Metropolis:** How many miles of commuting.<br>
